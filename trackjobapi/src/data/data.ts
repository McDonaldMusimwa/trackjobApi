    text: `For many beginners, Python and JavaScript are often the first programming languages they learn. But as you dive deeper into software development, you begin to realize how vast the programming world is — filled with powerful, strongly typed languages like C#, Java, and C++.

These languages are compiled, meaning the code you write cannot run directly; it must first be translated into machine code by a compiler.

Now, back to the point of this article: if you’ve already built a simple Express server using JavaScript, switching to TypeScript is often the next logical step. However, you may encounter a few challenges, because Node.js doesn’t understand TypeScript natively — your TypeScript code must be compiled to JavaScript before Node can run it.`,
